# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project is a simple web-based application that allows users to draw a digit (0-9) using their mouse or touchpad, and then predict the digit using a machine learning model. The application provides an interactive canvas where users can freely draw their digit, clear the drawing, and get a predicted result.
